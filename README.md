- 👋 Hi, I’m d'OldGeek
- 👀 I’m interested in all things computers.  I've been involved for 65 years.
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning Dos Batch files, Powershell, and VisualStudio. Also learning Rust, Python, Anaconda and Pycharm IDE, Git and Discord.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust DataBase, and anything else that stricks my fancy. Just starting with GitHub.
